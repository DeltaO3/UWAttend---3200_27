# UWAttend User Manual

Welcome to the UWAttend Web Application. This user manual will guide you through the primary functions of the website, including how to navigate the Home Page, Session Configuration, Unit Configuration, and the Administrator Page.

## Home Page
### Overview

[Insert home page here]

The Home Page serves as the central dashboard where facilitators manage the session in progress, sign in and out students and access student information.

### Session Information Display

[Insert session display here]

At the top of the page, the current session title is prominently displayed. This includes details such as:

- The session name (1-Workshop)
- The session date (2024-10-08)
- The session time (Morning)

This information help facilitators keep trach of which session they are managing.

### Signing Individual Students In/Out

[Insert search bar here]

To sign in a student, use the search bar with the submit button to type in the student you want to sign in. You can search for a student by the following criteria:

- Full name
- Student Number
- Preffered Name

A student who is not signed into the current session will be highlighted **GREEN** to indicate you are signing this student in. A student who is signed into the current session will be highlighted **RED** to indicate you are signing this student out.

[insert green and red student here]

Once a student is selected to be signed in, you may be prompted to ask the student if they consent to their photograph being taken in this class. If the student agrees then select **YES**. If they do not then select **NO**. If selected no, you will prompted to ask again everytime this student attends the class again.

As you sign in students, the page will update to show how many students have signed in and how many are expected to attend (e.g., "10 signed in of 10").

To sign out a student, use the same search bar with the submit button and type in the student you want to sign out. A message will appear saying you have signed out this student. 

### Viewing Student Information

[insert student page here]

Once a student has been signed in, you can click on each student's name from that list that appears. This will bring up a page which allows facilitators to review and update details related to individual students within a session. 

The page contains the following information:

- Student Name: Displays the full name of the student
- Student ID: Displays the UWA student ID
- Sign-in Time: Displays the time the student signed in
- Sign-out Time: Displays the time the student signed out
- Login Button: 
- Photo Consent Button: This checknox indicates whether the student has given consent for photographs or not.
- Grade Field: Facilitators can input or edit the student's grade for the session in this field.
- Leave/edit Comments: Facilitators can leave notes or comments regarding the students participation, behaviour or any other relevant information during the session.
- Remove Student: Used to remove a student from a session. This is will REMOVE them from the class entirely.

You may wish to save any changes you made on this page by clicking the "Save Changes" button. If you wish to revert or go back to the home page then click "Cancel".


### Class List Search

[Insert search here]

If the class list is long and you wish to search for a student who is signed in the class, you can use the class list search bar. This will filter out a student by either their name or student ID.

### Sign All Students Out

[insert button here]

At the bottom of the page is a "Sign All Out" button. This allows the facilitator to sign out all students in the session simultaneously, which is useful at the end of a session.

Before you sign all the students out, make sure to do a head count and see if that number matches the signed in students number. If it does you can safely sign all students out. Otherwise, search through the class list to see which students are missing.

### Exiting the Session
Once the session has concluded or you wish to leave your current session, you can click the "Exit Session" button. This will close the session and erase the current session progress. It will then take you to the "Session Configuration" page to start a new session.
