## Home Page
### Overview

[Insert home page here]

The Home Page serves as the central dashboard where facilitators manage the session in progress, sign in and out students and access student information.

### Session Information Display

At the top of the page, the current session title is prominently displayed. This includes details such as:

- The session name (1-Workshop)
- The session date (2024-10-08)
- The session time (Morning)

This information help facilitators keep trach of which session they are managing.

### Signing Individual Students In/Out

To sign in a student, use the search bar with the submit button to type in the student you want to sign in. You can search for a student by the following criteria:

- Full name
- Student Number
- Preffered Name

A student who is not signed into the current session will be highlighted **GREEN** to indicate you are signing this student in. A student who is signed into the current session will be highlighted **RED** to indicate you are signing this student out.

Once a student is selected to be signed in, you may be prompted to ask the student if they consent to their photograph being taken in this class. If the student agrees then select **YES**. If they do not then select **NO**. If selected no, you will prompted to ask again everytime this student attends the class again.

As you sign in students, the page will update to show how many students have signed in and how many are expected to attend (e.g., "10 signed in of 10").

To sign out a student, use the same search bar with the submit button and type in the student you want to sign out. A message will appear saying you have signed out this student.
